# MyWishlist

Wishlist is an app that that allows users to log in and create a list of items they would love to receive as gifts. This wishlist comes in handy during the holiday season when gifts are exchagned and everyone is trying to figure out what to get each other. It can also be useful for birthdays or other times of celebration. 

User Stories: 

As a User, I want to be able to add items to my wishlist so that the list can be updated with the things I've most recently been wanting or thinking about.

As a User, I want to delete items from my wishlist so that items I no longer want or items that I have alrady purchased will not remain displayed on the list.

As a User I want to edit items on my list so that I can make corrections to the details. 

As a User I want the ability to view the details of any item on the wishlist so that I (and friends + family) can have access to more information about the product. 

As a User I want to easily navigate to and from the wishlist from other pages ('Add wish', 'Edit wish' etc.)


Struggles: 

Two major areas I struggled in were the ability to upload images using multer and the CSS. I would like to continue working on this project and try to use multer so that the User isn't limited to the images found online, and I would love to familiarize myself with bootstrap to make the app look better as a whole. 

Another aspect of this app I would like to continue working on is the ability to export/email or share your wishlist. 

Successes: 

User can log in and the shoppable links can be added for each wishlist item.
